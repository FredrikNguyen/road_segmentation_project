# Road segmentation from satellite images using 'machine learning techniques'

## About the Project

The aim of this project is to train a 'model classifier' that extracts roads in a set of aerial images aquired from GoogleMaps. From each image provided to train the model there is a ground-truth form of that image where each pixel is labeled as road or background.  We are also provided by a set of images, from where we will test our model by producing our classifier's ground-truth version of those images. Essentially the goal reduces to train a classifier to assign a label `road = 1`, `background = 0` to each pixel.
